  * User should be able to input parameters (products) with speech-recognition function
  * At least two languages should be initially introduced: english and polish
  * In future we should think of saving the rest of products, which are still in user's fridge; also application should not store those information longer than specified time (e.g. 1-2 weeks)
  * Ingredients set ahould increase with nb of recipes stored, so we do not store ingredients, which do not exists in any recipe
